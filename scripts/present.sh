# Presentation conductor — plays a code walkthrough with synced highlights + voice.
# Reads a generated script of highlight + narration steps.
# Usage: present.sh [--stream] <script_file>
#   where script_file contains lines of: FILE|START|END|NARRATION
#
# Batch mode (default): Reads complete file, processes all lines.
# Stream mode (--stream): Follows file with tail -f, processes lines as they
#   appear. Stops when it encounters an "END" line. Use this when the script
#   is being generated progressively — playback starts immediately while new
#   lines are still being appended.
#
# Send SIGTERM or SIGINT to stop.
