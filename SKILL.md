# Code Explainer

Interactive code walkthrough. Scans the codebase for a feature, builds a segment plan, then walks through each segment — highlighting code in VS Code and explaining at their chosen depth.

## Models

Configure your preferred models here. All docs reference these tiers by name — change them once and the whole skill updates.

| Tier | Default | Role |
|------|---------|------|
| `LARGE` | `opus` | Deep Dive planner — narrative reasoning, transition objects |
| `MEDIUM` | `sonnet` | Deep Dive segment agents — deep code reading, dense highlights |
| `SMALL` | `haiku` | Scout, Overview plan+highlights — fast exploration and scanning |

When dispatching sub-agents, look up the model for the tier and use that exact model name.

## Checklist

Complete these steps in order:

0. **Parallel init** — Dispatch both in a **single response**:
   - **Sidebar check (Bash):** `PORT=$(cat ~/.claude-explainer-port 2>/dev/null) && TOKEN=$(cat ~/.claude-explainer-token 2>/dev/null) && curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:$PORT/api/health"` — `{"status":"ok"}` means sidebar is active. When active, **NEVER output walkthrough content as terminal text**; all output goes through sidebar HTTP API only.
   - **Ask preferences (AskUserQuestion):** Read `docs/assess.md` and ask all three questions listed there (familiarity + depth level + delivery mode) in a single call. Do NOT skip any or invent new ones.

1. **Scout** — Read `docs/scan.md`. Dispatch `SMALL` sub-agent to discover relevant files and map the call chain. No highlights yet — discovery only.
2. **Plan + generate** — Two paths depending on depth:
   - **Overview** — Single `SMALL` sub-agent reads scout output, builds plan, generates highlights in one pass. Send `set_plan` when done.
   - **Deep Dive** — Read `docs/plan.md`. Dispatch `LARGE` planner to build narrative + transition objects, send stub `set_plan` immediately. Then read `docs/segments.md` and dispatch parallel `MEDIUM` segment agents (capped at 5). Fire `replace_segment` as each completes.
3. **Execute walkthrough** — Read the doc for chosen mode: `docs/walkthrough.md`, `docs/read.md`, or `docs/podcast.md`. Walkthrough and podcast reference `docs/tts.md`.
4. **Wrap up** — 3-5 key takeaways, how feature fits the broader architecture, offer to dive deeper or explain related features.

**First-time setup?** Read `docs/setup.md`.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Scope too large | Stick to segment boundaries. Overview: max 80 lines, Deep Dive: max 40. Split if bigger |
| Not connecting segments | Include a context line linking to previous segment |
| Forgetting to highlight | Sidebar: automatic. Fallback: write to `~/.claude-highlight.json` |
| Reading entire file | Use offset+limit on Read for just the segment |
| Not waiting for user | Pause after each segment for questions |
| ttsText missing or has markdown | Include plain `ttsText` in every segment — strip backticks, bold, line refs from spoken text |
| Explaining obvious code, missing the "why" | Skip standard patterns (loops, imports, null checks). Always explain intent before mechanism |
| Ignoring complexity tags | `[core]` = thorough, `[wiring]` = breeze through, `[supporting]` = brief |
| Sidebar check not parallelized | Dispatch Bash health check + AskUserQuestion in one response, not sequentially |
| Text output when sidebar active | If health check returned ok, send plan JSON only — no terminal text |
| Sub-highlights too broad | Deep Dive: 1 line per highlight, 15-30 per segment. Every arg, assignment, and condition gets its own highlight. Overview: 1-8 lines, 3-6 per segment |
| Wrong field names in sidebar JSON | Use `start`/`end`/`title`/`ttsText`/`highlights` — NOT `startLine`/`endLine`/`label`/`subHighlights`. See `docs/plan.md` for exact schema |
| Skipping `set_plan` before `goto` | Sidebar needs the full plan loaded first. Always send stub `set_plan` via `explainer.sh plan` before any `goto` or `replace_segment` messages |
| Waiting for all segments before showing plan | Deep Dive: send stub `set_plan` immediately after planner. Fire `replace_segment` per agent as they finish. Don't batch |
| Scout generating highlights | Scout only maps files and call chain. Highlights are generated in step 2 (Overview: single agent, Deep Dive: parallel agents) |
| Running planner + parallel agents for Overview | Overview uses one fast `SMALL` agent for plan + highlights. Planner and segment agents are Deep Dive only |
| Using tier names as literal model names | `LARGE`, `MEDIUM`, `SMALL` are placeholders — always resolve to the actual model name from the Models table in SKILL.md before dispatching |
